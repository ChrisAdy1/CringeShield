## ✅ ONBOARDING (Screen 1)
- [ ] Show this tour only for first-time users (use localStorage flag: `hasSeenTour`)
- [ ] Add 3–4 screens max:
    1. Welcome + benefit
    2. Pick prompt or write your own
    3. Record + reflect
    4. Track confidence over time
- [ ] Use Accent Lavender (#EDE9FE) for tour background
- [ ] Highlight primary action with soft purple (#9A7DFF)
- [ ] Add smooth "Next" and "Skip" transitions
- [ ] Auto-focus "Start Quick Practice" or "Start Video Practice" at the end of tour

## ✅ DASHBOARD PAGE (Screens 2–4)

### 1. Confidence Tracker
- [ ] Use a color-changing confidence bar:
    - 0–30% = light gray (#E0E0E0)
    - 30–70% = Warning Peach (#FFD6A5)
    - 70–100% = Success Mint (#C7F9CC)
- [ ] Add animated increase when new session added
- [ ] Placeholder graph line across the week, even if no data

### 2. Start a Practice Session
- [ ] Confirm “Quick Practice” auto-generates a random prompt from all categories
- [ ] Add logic to store which mode was used (Quick or Video) in session tracking

### 3. Prompt Categories
- [ ] Add basic filter logic (optional): when clicking a category, filter prompts on next screen
- [ ] Add “Write Your Own” card or toggle in the category section or prompt picker
- [ ] Use Accent Lavender as card background hover or selected state

### 4. Daily Tip
- [ ] Optional: Rotate tips daily (use simple array and date-based index)
- [ ] Store `lastTipDate` in localStorage to avoid changing too often
- [ ] Highlight the tip card with soft background (e.g., #EDE9FE) and lightbulb icon in #9A7DFF

### 5. Friendly Microcopy (Polish)
- [ ] Update empty state text for “0 sessions completed” → “Let’s get your first one done!”
- [ ] Same for 0% confidence: “Your confidence journey starts here!”

### 6. Footer
- [ ] Add linkable Help / Privacy / Terms
- [ ] Optional: make “CringeShield – Your safe space to practice speaking” a clickable About link
