Help users build confidence in speaking on camera

Provide AI-driven feedback in a non-judgmental way

Offer progressive exercises and tools for improvement

Allow users to track their comfort level and progress over time

I want to practice speaking on camera without anyone watching

I want AI to give me feedback on my tone, clarity, facial expressions, and posture

I want to blur or cartoonize my face while I practice to reduce anxiety

I want encouraging, non-critical feedback to help me improve
